# InputSwitcher

This is a set of scripts where ahk and powershell combines to achieve the following:

-force English input when the active window has keywords oir is full screen(in keywords.txt, start a new line and add words to it)

-force Chinese input when the above conditions don't met

-ctrl+alt+p will quit the script and change the input language list back to normal




Warning: Do not quit the script without using ctrl+alt+p, the script will clear other input types during use and only ctrl+alt+p can bring inputs back to normal!

These 2 scripts were written and locally debugged for 3.5 hours in total, expect bugs and not-so-user-friendly quirks, feel free to make changes to them if you see fit.
